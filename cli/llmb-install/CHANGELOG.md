# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project uses [PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) versioning with semantic versioning semantics:
**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** for feature parity with [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- NVIDIA Run:ai platform support for headless (`--play`) installs via a top-level `platform: runai` key and a `runai:` config block (project, PVC claim/mount, container image, RoCE/GDR extended resources, Multus annotations). Generates a `platform: runai` `cluster_config.yaml` for `llmb-run`. See `example_config_runai.yaml`.
- Optional Run:ai image pre-pull helper (`LLMB_RUNAI_PREPULL_NODES`, `LLMB_RUNAI_PREPULL`) to warm node containerd caches before the first benchmark.
- Headless incremental workload add via `express`: when the install path already contains an installation, `express --workloads <list>` (or `--exemplar`) now adds the requested workloads — reusing the locked `cluster_config` settings, existing `llmb_repo` (no repo copy), and existing venvs — instead of exiting. Previously incremental adds were interactive-only (the `questionary` checkbox requires a TTY), which broke automation/CI over non-interactive SSH.

### Notes

- On `platform: runai`, installation uses the `local` method: HF assets/tools are prefetched on the login node and Run:ai pulls the container image directly (no enroot/`.sqsh` build). Authentication is `runai login` (SSO) — no Run:ai Application credentials.

## [1.9.1] - 2026-05-04

### Fixed

- Accept trillion-parameter (`t`) model-size suffixes when selecting Exemplar Cloud workloads from `exemplar.yaml`.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-04-24

### Changed

- Fresh interactive and express installs now create recipe environments with `uv` without prompting for an environment type; existing conda/venv configs remain supported for resume, incremental, and headless compatibility.

### Removed

- Removed unsupported legacy `setup_script` installation support; recipes should use `setup.tasks`.

### Fixed

- Workloads without Python dependencies no longer run through the legacy scripted-install path or emit deprecation warnings.

## [1.8.7] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Migrated config models (`InstallConfig`, `SlurmConfig`, `SystemConfig`) from dataclasses to pydantic v2; field types are now enforced at construction (e.g. `Literal` for `venv_type`, `gpu_type` validated against `SUPPORTED_GPU_TYPES`).

## [1.8.6] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- Resume from failed install now preserves venv paths for previously completed workloads in the state file; repeated failures no longer produce a `cluster_config.yaml` with missing venv entries.
- venv creation errors now include full stderr output alongside the failed command; previously only the exit code was shown.
- uv venv creation now removes existing directory before creating instead of relying on `uv venv --clear`, which can fail in edge-cases.
- GRES auto-detection now uses sinfo node counts (`%D`) to pick the GPU count backed by the most nodes; previously heterogeneous partitions could randomly select the minority value.

## [1.8.5] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed

- `InstallConfig` now raises on null `environment_vars` values and coerces remaining values to strings; prevents YAML nulls from leaking into subprocess env dicts.
- Top-level error handler now includes exception type and hints at `--verbose` for full traceback.

## [1.8.4] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed

- Fix v1→v2 cluster config migration dropping GRES values due to wrong field names (`gpu_gres`/`cpu_gres` → `gpu_partition_gres`/`cpu_partition_gres`).

## [1.8.3] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Conda environment option now shows `(deprecated)` label in the environment selection prompt.

### Fixed

- User-initiated exits now consistently return code `130` (prompt cancel/exit choices), so `install.sh` no longer shows a misleading `SUCCESS` summary on cancellation.
- Express mode now exits with code `1` when pointed at an existing installation path.

## [1.8.2] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- Improved wrapped installer UX with structured post-install summary handoff and clearer end-of-run messaging.
- Treat Ctrl-C as exit code 130 so wrapper scripts can distinguish cancellation and avoid printing redundant summaries.

## [1.8.1] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed

- Corrected SLURM GRES detection for comma-separated partition lists and fail fast on incompatible partition GRES combinations.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-02-18

### Changed

- `cluster_config.yaml` is now written in schema v2, requires llmb-run >= 1.10.0

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-09

### Changed

- Clone-only git dependencies (`install_method.type: clone`) excluded from venv sharing hash (these dependencies are outside venv); workloads differing only in clone-only commits now share a venv
- Git cloning is now per-workload, allowing different clone-only commits within a shared venv group

### Fixed

- Write partial `cluster_config.yaml` when some workloads succeed but others fail
- Resume completion now includes all workloads (prior + current) in final config instead of only remaining

## [1.6.3] - 2026-02-05

### Fixed

- Headless mode now shows "workload not supported for gpu_type" instead of generic "not found" error
- Record mode (`--record`) no longer copies the repository or creates cache directories

## [1.6.2] - 2026-02-02

### Fixed

- Constrained transformers dependency to >4.57.3,\<5.0.0 (backported to 25.12 maintenance branch as 1.6.0.post1)

## [1.6.1] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- Comma-separated partition list support for SLURM configuration (e.g., `gpu1,gpu2`)

### Changed

- Improved incremental install resume prompt wording
- SLURM partition/account validation now strictly enforces valid values (fail-fast)

### Fixed

- Installation path prompt now requires absolute paths and rejects empty/confusing inputs

## [1.6.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added

- HuggingFace downloads v2 via `downloads.huggingface` (tokenizer + `config.json`, supports remote-code tokenizers).

### Changed

- Enforce `transformers>4.57.3`.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- Headless playfiles now use top-level `slurm` and `environment_vars` (and fail fast on deprecated keys).

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- B300 support
- GPU ordering in GPU selection prompt

## [1.5.0] - 2025-12-24

### Changed

### Fixed

- Missing `urllib.error` import for download error handling in tools module
- Improved validation error messages for null/invalid `downloads` metadata

## [1.4.1] - 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- HuggingFace tokenizer downloads now uses hf login, instead of relying on token passed to individual functions.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-15

### Added

- HuggingFace tokenizer download support via `hf_tokenizers` in metadata.yaml

### Changed

- Refactored download code into unified `downloads/` module

## [1.3.13] - 2025-12-10

## [1.0.1] - 2025-09-18

### Changed

- Only compile bytecode for the last package when using uv, as it compiles the full venv.

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-17

## [0.11.2] - 2025-08-28

### Changed

- Moved installer to 'cli/llmb-install'
- Updated repo root detection logic

## [0.11.1] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed

- Downgraded 'prompt_toolkit\<3.0.52' to work around questionary incompatibility

## [0.11.0] - 2025-08-26

### Added

- UV environment support with automatic preference order: uv → venv → conda
- Unified cache management for both PIP and UV cache directories

### Changed

- Cache directories automatically configured under `$LLMB_INSTALL/.cache/`, if not set in user environment.
- venv creation now ensures it's not using a virtual environment. Usually system Python.

### Fixed

- System Python detection bug when running from virtual environments

## [0.10.2] - 2025-08-18

### Fixed

- Force conda auto_activate to false. Handles an edge case on systems where login and compute nodes have different architectures.

## [0.10.1] - 2025-08-14

### Fixed

- Force conda environment usage when installer is run from within a conda environment to prevent venv dependency issues on parent environment.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-08-11

### Added

- GPU-specific overrides in metadata:
  - `container.images` supports `by_gpu` with `h100`, `b200`, `gb200`, and `default`.
  - `repositories` supports top-level `by_gpu` to select per-GPU repo commits.
- New installer resolver `resolve_gpu_overrides` to materialize GPU-specific images/repos before install.
- Schema extended to allow future `by_model` conditionals for images and repositories (not yet wired in installer).

### Changed

- Venv grouping now hashes a canonical dependencies signature that ignores non-functional differences (e.g., script vs pip-git acquisition, wrappers), so identical effective commits share a venv.
- Editable pip dependencies force an isolated venv per recipe to avoid cross-recipe interference.
